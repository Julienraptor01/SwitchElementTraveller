# Looking for help: <br>
Since with the newest update I added multi-language support now I need translators for missing languages:<br>
- es-ES
- ro-RO
- zh-CN
- zh-TW <br>

The task is simple, I just need you to translate 6 lines of text <br>
<a href="https://github.com/Penelopeep/SwitchElementTraveller/blob/Main/src/main/resources/en_US.json">The file to translate is this</a> and translated one send me on discord <b>Penelopeep#7963</b>, or make pull request if you want ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ <br>
You'll be included in this readme

# SwitchElement
Simple, mostly stolen script from one of pr in official gc, which allows to quickly change traveller element.<br>
Original pr: https://github.com/Grasscutters/Grasscutter/pull/1287 <br>
I just added dendro and changed it to plugin. <br>
### Credits:
- hartie95#8966 for amazing help with rewriting code
- RomanF#0609 for Russian translation
- Praë#0009 for French translations

## Usage
Use /se <element> or /switchelement <element> <br>
Elements: white/anemo/geo/electro/dendro <br>
white = no element <br><br>
For dendro you need to have:
1. Genshin 2.8.5 beta
2. Grasscutter supporting that version


## Building
I don't know why would you want to build it but:
1. Download maven from apache website
2. Open command prompt/powershell in your project folder (Sorry Linux and MacOS users, you'll need to find your own way for this)
3. Run <b>mvn package</b>
4. Now jar file should be in new target folder

### Version
The plugin is based on plugin template from Grasscutters GitHub.

## If you're having problem with plugin similar to this:<br>
